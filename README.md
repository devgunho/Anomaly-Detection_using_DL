### #01 Isolation Forest

Isolation forest is the first anomaly detection algorithm that identifies anomalies using isolation.

It was initially proposed and developed by Fei Tony Liu, Kai Ming Ting and Zhi-Hua Zhou in 2008.

### #02 One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM)

One-Class Support Vector Machines (OCSVM) are one of the state-of-the-art approaches for novelty detection (or anomaly detection) in machine learning, due to their flexibility in fitting complex nonlinear boundaries between {normal} and {novel} data.
